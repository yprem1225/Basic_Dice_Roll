🎲 Dice Roll Game (HTML • CSS • JavaScript)

This is a basic interactive dice roll game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application displays two dice, one for each player. Every time the user clicks the “Roll Dice” button, both dice generate random numbers between 1 and 6, and the dice images update dynamically.

Based on the values rolled, the game compares both dice and instantly displays the result — Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, or a draw. The page updates smoothly using DOM manipulation, without reloading the browser.

The project focuses on:

JavaScript random number generation

DOM selection and manipulation

Event handling using a button click

Clean and responsive UI using CSS

This project is ideal for beginners to understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
